#Burkholderia Search

This test is from a BLAST search that was performed by Damion Dooley with the Galaxy NCBI BLAST+ blastn Package on BCCDCs Galaxy Server. The first BLAST was run in December 2013, the second in August 2014.

The results were obtained from running the main.py script via the command line:

´´´bash
python main.py -o burkholderia_old.tabular -n burkholderia_new.tabular -Al -s result.txt
